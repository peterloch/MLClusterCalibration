# MLClusterCalibration

This respository contains code to plot responses and other cluster features in the context of the ML-based topo-cluster calibration project. In addition several scripts are available converting inputs from root to csv and vice versa, setup the environment and others.

The typical workflow for making plots to evaluate the topo-cluster response as function of cluster signals and moments (inputs to the DNN calibration) comprise 1Ô∏è‚É£ the transformation of the testing output to `root` files with a tree `ClusterTree` (default) as needed, followed by 2Ô∏è‚É£ the filling and storing of (mostly) 2-dimensional histgrams showing the responses at various scales (EM, LCW and ML-based). 

## Generating response plots üÜï

Plotting uses the `ROOT` tuple as input. This tuple can be constructed from a csv file by 
```
root -l 'readCSV.C("results.csv","ml_pions.root")'
```
for single particles (typically a mixed file with clusters from neutral and charged pions) or
```
root -l `readCSV.C("results.csv","ml_jets.root")'
```
for jets. **It is highly recommended to use the output (ROOT) file names given in these examples. They are expected by the plotting scripts.**[^1]
In both cases the output file contains a tree named `ClusterTree` with branches corresponding to the colummn headers in the csv file.

Next, the main plotter module coded in `ClusterTreePlotter.C` is run. This module is universal, it can be used for topo-clusters from single particles as well as those from jets. It will add some source-sepcific plots automatically. It also generates an output file with a presently hard-coded name `ml_pions.hist.root` for pions (same for neutral, charged or mixed samples) and `ml_jets.hist.root` for jets. These outputs (mostly 2-dimensional hstograms of type `TH2D`) are used for further analysis.

It is recommended to not use `ClusterTeePlotter.C` directly. Rather, use the specific scripts provided for the plotting:

| Topo-cluster source | Script            | Expected input  | Output files         |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| &pi;<sup>0</sup>    | `plotPi0.C`       | `ml_pions.root` | `ml_pions.hist.root` |
| &pi;<sup>&pm;</sup> | `plotPiCharged.C` | `ml_pions.root` | `ml_pions.hist.root` |
| mixed &pi; sample   | `plotPi.C`        | `ml_pions.root` | `ml_pions.hist.root` |
| jets                | `plotJets.C`      | `ml_jets.root`  | `ml_jets.hist.root`  |

**Note:** The `ml_pions.root` file should contain topo-clusters from both neutral and charged pions - it is just the output from the training and/or testing of the DNN calibration.

**Note:** The output file names are constructed from the inout file name by adding `.hist` before the file name extension/file type `root`.

The plotting scripts are simply run by[^2]
```
root -l -b -q plotPiCharged.C++
```

[^1]: :hammer_and_wrench: TODO: allow user-defined file names in plotting scripts `plotPi.C`, `plotPi0.C`, `plotPiCharged.C` and `plotJets.c`.
[^2]: <a name="compile">It is recommended to run the scripts in batch mode (`-b` option in the `root` command line &ndash; the `-q` option just terminates `root` after the script is executed. Also, to speed up future invacations of the plotting script, it is useful to compile the script by adding the `++` after the file extension `.C` when compiling the script for the first time orr after `ClusterTreePlotter.C` has been changed. A repeated invocation of the same script can then use the command line `root -l -b -q plotPiCharged.C+` with the a single `+` added after the file extension.</a> 

## Generating summary plots

### 2-dimensional response distributions

The final formatting and display of the distributions created by the plotting scripts is done using the `plotCusters.C` macro. It is invoked by 
```
root -l 'plotClusters.C++("ml_pions.hist.root","plots",50)'
```
The use of the `++` (or `+`) is motivated by the complexity and size of the invoked code. Pre-compilation makes bug finding easier and execution faster. Similar to what has been discussed for the plotting scripts in [footnote 2](#compile) at the bottom of this page.

The `plotClusters.C` macro has three optional arguments, 
```
plotClusters(<input_file_name>,<output_plot_directory>,<minimum_entries>)
```
with 
| Argument                  | Default setting        | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<input_file_name>`       | `"ml_pions.hist.root"` | Name of input file produced by one of the plotting scripts                                     |
| `<output_plot_directory>` | `"plots"`              | Name of directory to store in produced plots in (see remarks below)                            |
| `<minimum_entries>`       | `50`                   | Minimum entries required in a histogram slice to calculate the average and standard deviations |

The script geberates the fully formatted plots and saves them into the directory `<output_plot_directory` which is expected to exist in the same directory as the input file. **This directory needs to be created before running the script for the first time!** In case the directory is already existing, the files in it will be overwritten. 

Each plot is saved as a PDf and a PNG file (two files per plot). In addition, all distributions, graphs and canvases are saved into a `ROOT` file for further analysis and/or display. The output file name is constructed internally using the first part of the input file name, e.g. input file name `ml_jets.hist.root` yields output file name `ml_jets_summary.root`. The output file is saved in the present working directory.

#### Example for plot storage

| Input file file name               | Directory for files with plots | Output file               |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `ml_pions.hist.root`               | `./plots`                      | `./ml_pions_summary.root` |
| `my_analysis/ml_pions.hist.root`   | `./my_analysis/plots`          | `./ml_pions_summary.root` |
| `/home/me/test/ml_pions.hist.root` | `/home/me/test/plots`          | `./ml_pions_summary.root` |

### Graphs with averages and errors

The graphs shown in the scatter plots can be plotted without the distributions. This is done by
```
root -l 'plotSummary.C++("ml_pions_summary.root","RMS")'
```
The input arguments for this macro are the input file name (no default, must be supplied by the user) and the error bar option (default is `"RMS"`, meaning the errors shown in the plots are the standard deviations. If the option `"ERR"` is given, the error of the means will be shown instead. Both the standard deviations as well as the errors on the mean are asymmetric. The results will be stored in a `plots` which is in the same path as the input file.[^3]

[^3]: üõ†Ô∏è:exclamation::exclamation: There is a limitation in the present implementation of `plotSummary.C`. To avoid crashes and unpredictable behaviour, the input file name should always contain a path. This means that instead of using `ml_jets_summary.root` one should use `./ml_jets_summary.root` if the input file is in the present working directory. The `plots` directory needs to exist, as in case of the plots with the distributions.
